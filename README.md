# Py-Turtle

Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.

Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. After an import turtle, give it the command turtle.forward(15), and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves. Give it the command turtle.right(25), and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.

Py turtle provides a simple set of functions that allow users to draw shapes, lines, and colors on a graphical canvas, as well as to control the turtle's movement and appearance. It can be used to create a wide variety of simple and complex drawings and animations, including fractals, spirals, and games. Py turtle is included in the standard Python distribution and is easy to learn for beginners, making it a popular tool for teaching programming concepts and logic. It also has a variety of built-in features such as event handling, image processing, and sound.
